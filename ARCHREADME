Now that your packages are installed properly, you must create a 
PostgreSQL user, initialize the tent_status database, and run the 
command to start the TentStatus server.

If this is the first time you've installed or run PostgreSQL on this 
machine, run the following commands to setup and initialize the database 
directory:

    # sudo mkdir /var/lib/postgres/data
    # sudo chown -c postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgres/data
    # sudo initdb -D ‘/var/lib/postgres/data’
    # sudo systemctl start postgresql
    # sudo systemctl enable postgresql


Assign your PostgreSQL an admin password:

    # sudo -u postgres psql postgres
    postgres=# \password postgres


Create a PostgreSQL user with which you can access the database. This 
will match the username you use to operate your TentStatus server. It is 
recommended that this username match that of your Unix user.

    # sudo -u postgres createuser $username


Run the following to create the database. If you use a different 
username than that of your Unix user, make sure to prefix the command 
with "sudo -u $username".

    # createdb tent_status


The following command enables the TentStatus server (all on one line):

# DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost/tent_status APP_NAME=’TentStatus 
Standalone’ COOKIE_SECRET=abc bundle exec puma -p 3000


If you are running your TentStatus server on the same machine as your 
tentd-admin implementation, remember to change the port to something 
else, like 3001. 

Note that the server cannot be run in the background under the current 
configuration. For more information, or to see some environment 
variables that may be useful based on your situation, visit the README 
at https://github.com/tent/tent-status.
